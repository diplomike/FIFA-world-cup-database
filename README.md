The program can be downloaded via https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ckM1noMH6ge_M9CXegjWZkDlSfrz46C0/view?usp=sharing. I understand this is not how GitHub works and I am not familiar with this, but I just want to find a place to share my work so I cannot care less. 

This is a program created by MS Access database for the FIFA World Cup Tournaments. It can compute the group standings and knockout stage results based on manual input of the scores of each match. Previous match results have been entered from the 2006 tournament onwards until the 2022 tournament, of which only the match details are entered. New tournaments can also be set up by entering the match details, with country profiles showing the historical record of each nation. 

Inspired by a similar program created by Graham Paramore using MS Excel for the 2006 FIFA World Cup, it started out as a project of personal interest which evolved over a decade to eventually culminate in the present file. I believe I have cleared all the major bugs but feel free to let me know if you have noticed any significant error, or just want to give me a hug for the hard work.
